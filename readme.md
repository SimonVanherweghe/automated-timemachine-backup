# Automate Time Machine Backups

## Scenario

I have a USB disk for Time Machine backups that is plugged in to my external monitor USB hub. Every time I hook up my computer to the screen, that volume is mounted. But I always forget to unmount it when I unplug my computer from the screen. This will lead to ðŸ’© sooner or later.

## Goals

- Prevent the disk from being mounted when I plug in my computer to the screen
- At a certain time of day (night), mount the disk and start a Time Machine backup, unmount when ready.

## Locations

- time-machine-mount-run-unmount.sh: /usr/local/bin/timemachine-mount-run-unmount.sh
- fstab: /etc/fstab
- com.donebysimon.timemachine-mount-run-unmount.plist: ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.donebysimon.timemachine-mount-run-unmount.plist

## Gotchas

- a plist file doesn't seem to like newlines inside tags. Watch out with a xml formatter for that one.
- You can test a plist file with 'plutil'
- `launchctl load` seems to be deprecated
- Got it finally up and running with <https://www.soma-zone.com/LaunchControl/>
